# Object Detection Model using MRCNN

This aims in creating a bounding box around the object which was used to train the MRCNN. The MRCNN is trained with the images as input and it is expected to return the bounding box region as output.

# To run

Use the req.txt file to download all the packages using `pip install -r req.txt` and make sure you setup MRCNN as specified in the readme present in the mask_rcnn folder. Once that is done, you can train and test the mrcnn. <b>Please go through the code present in main.py to understand how to train and test the mrcnn.</b>
